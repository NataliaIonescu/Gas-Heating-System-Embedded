Create a program that prints in the serial monitor an analog value of a potentiometer.
● The first 33% light a green LED
● The first 33-66% light a yellow LED and the green LED
● At 66-100% light up a red LED, and the others are off.

Real-time practical application: Gas heating systems. The potentiometer could be a pressure sensor. If the pressure gets too high shut off a valve (the red LED) to avoid killing people.
